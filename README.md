# About ChastityApp
Here you will find the (almost) full code from the ChastiKey app (packaged and rebranded as ChastityApp). This repository includes the app code written in AGK (https://appgamekit.com), and the server files written in PHP.

The AGK app code relies heavily on the OryUI framework which I also created in AGK. OryUI has been included in this repository, but can also be found here: https://github.com/KevinCrossDCL/OryUI

All private and sensitive code (including authentication) have been removed.

You can use any of the code and logic for creating a similar chastity app, or just as a reference. You can also use any of the images provided in this repository.

# Licensing
