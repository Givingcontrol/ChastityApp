# About ChastityApp
Here you will find the (almost) full code from the ChastiKey app (packaged and rebranded as ChastityApp). This repository includes the app code written in AGK (https://appgamekit.com), and the server files written in PHP. 

The code is taken from an older version of the ChastiKey app: v2.6.8, so it won't have all of the features and bug fixes that have been added since. To convert the code for public use takes time which is why I've not done it for later versions. A later version may be added in the future.

The AGK app code relies heavily on the OryUI framework which I also created in AGK. OryUI has been included in this repository, but can also be found here: https://github.com/KevinCrossDCL/OryUI

All private and sensitive code (including authentication) have been removed.

You can use any of the code and logic for creating a similar chastity app, or just as a reference. You can also use any of the images provided in this repository.

# Things To Know
If you're going to use the repository as it is, using the supplied PHP scripts, and the AGK app and code, then you will probably need to set the MySQL database as MariaDB for some of the queries to work.
